% Choose a couple systems and ideas, match them to my current state of the work and write that how and why it would improve the current state of the work by referencing the assumptions part in the approach section.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Monitoring Improvement, higher task coverage, better ebpf, lower overhead, better energy models
    \item More in-depth time-series treatment for better feature-vectors
    \item Dimensionality reduction, feature selection based on highest explanation
    \item More sophisticated affinity score calculation based on lower-level interference measurements
    \item Treatment of static time-series for distance calculation
    \item Refinement of regression approach within KCCA by comparing to other means
    \item Extending by more suitable or sophisticated models.
    \item Integrating cost-functions into the co-location strategies so that optimization problems can be formulated and account for single or multi-obectives.
    \item Extending and calibrating the simulation framework with energy-sources for more realistic simulation results
    \item Reformulating the co-location problem from consolidation problem into degredataion prediction

\end{enumerate}
