  abstract  = {Power consumption is a major obstacle for High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in their quest towards the holy grail of ExaFLOP performance. Significant advances in power efficiency have to be made before this goal can be attained and accurate modeling is an essential step towards power efficiency by optimizing system operating parameters to match dynamic energy needs. In this paper we present a study of power consumption by jobs in Eurora, a hybrid CPU-GPU-MIC system installed at the largest Italian data center. Using data from a dedicated monitoring framework, we build a data-driven model of power consumption for each user in the system and use it to predict the power requirements of future jobs. We are able to achieve good prediction results for over 80{\%} of the users in the system. For the remaining users, we identify possible reasons why prediction performance is not as good. Possible applications for our predictive modeling results include scheduling optimization, power-aware billing and system-scale power modeling. All the scripts used for the study have been made available on GitHub.},

  abstract = {An effective way to increase utilization in datacenters is to run batch jobs on the transient idle resources of latency-critical services. Such transient resources must be reclaimed once latency-critical services require them again, which severely hurts the performance of batch jobs. However, there is an increasing demand to provide predictable performance for users who have strict requirements for job completion times. In this paper, we present TCON, a transiency-aware controller that enables the safe colocations of batch jobs alongside latency-critical services while reducing job completion time SLO (Service Level Objective) misses. TCON makes some of the transient resources more valuable by providing reclaim probabilities to them. Since the transient resources left by different latency-critical services may have different capacities and reclaim probabilities, TCON formulates a cardinality-constrained portfolio model that can construct an optimal mix of transient resources for each batch job to achieve both high resource efficiency and low SLO misses. Furthermore, TCON exploits a partial checkpointing mechanism to minimize the re-computation cost in the case of reclaiming. Testbed experiments show that TCON is able to increase the average resource utilization to 45% and reduce the job completion time SLO misses to 16%.},

  abstract  = {Co-location of latency-critical services with best-effort batch jobs is commonly adopted in production systems to increase resource utilization. Although memory and CPU isolation have been extensively studied, we find Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) technology imposes non-trivial interference on memory access which jeopardizes efficient co-location and performance assurance of latency-critical services. However, there is not an existing metric to quantitatively measure and lacks a deterministic approach to tackle SMT interference on memory access.We present Holmes, a user-space approach to SMT interference diagnosis and adaptive CPU scheduling for efficient job co-location in multi-tenant systems. Holmes tackles two challenges: accurately measuring SMT interference on memory access, and efficiently adjusting CPU allocation to achieve low latency and high resource utilization at the same time. It leverages CPU hardware performance events to diagnose SMT interference on memory access and form a metric. It deploys an interference-aware scheduler to adaptively allocate CPU cores to latency-critical services and batch jobs. Experiments with four real-world key-value stores show that compared to a representative CPU isolation approach, Holmes reduces the average (99th percentile) query latency by up to 49.0\% (52.3\%) for four real-world latency-critical services. It also significantly improves convergence speed, resource utilization, and system throughput.},

  abstract = {Fog computing paradigm provides diverse processing resources and storage close to the edge of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Workflow scheduling is an open issue in fog computing as it addresses the deployment of IoT workflow tasks on fog cells. Deploying workflow tasks on fog cells in an inefficient manner can have negative consequences. It can lead to bandwidth waste, resource depletion, and significant operating expenses. Additionally, the majority of scheduling evolutionary algorithms suffer from premature convergence and sticking in local optima. In this paper, a predictive energy-aware scheduling framework is proposed as a MAPE-K control model consisting of the four Monitor, Analyzer, Planner and Executer components with a shared Knowledge base in fog computing. First, a prediction method applying an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) into an analyzer component is introduced to predict future resource load. Second, a resource management strategy based on predicted resource load is presented to reduce energy consumption. Third, the Improved Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) and weighted Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) are combined into a planner component called I-ALO-GWO for workflow scheduling. In the end, the decisions made in the previous steps are executed on the fog cells. The effectiveness of the I-ALO-GWO evolutionary algorithm has been tested on the IEEE CEC2019 benchmark functions. In addition, the proposed approach is evaluated practically under several famous scientific workflows using the iFogSim tool. Experimental results indicate that I-ALO-GWO improves the makespan up to 18 %, the energy consumption up to 17 %, the total execution cost up to 11 % and 26 % in terms of efficiency in comparison with the second-best results.},

  abstract = {Many HPC applications suffer from a bottleneck in the shared caches, instruction execution units, I/O or memory bandwidth, even though the remaining resources may be underutilized. It is hard for developers and runtime systems to ensure that all critical resources are fully exploited by a single application, so an attractive technique for increasing HPC system utilization is to colocate multiple applications on the same server. When applications share critical resources, however, contention on shared resources may lead to reduced application performance. In this paper, we show that server efficiency can be improved by first modeling the expected performance degradation of colocated applications based on measured hardware performance counters, and then exploiting the model to determine an optimized mix of colocated applications. This paper presents a new intelligent resource manager and makes the following contributions: (1) a new machine learning model to predict the performance degradation of colocated applications based on hardware counters and (2) an intelligent scheduling scheme deployed on an existing resource manager to enable application co-scheduling with minimum performance degradation. Our results show that our approach achieves performance improvements of 7% (avg) and 12% (max) compared to the standard policy commonly used by existing job managers.},

Big data can be awkward to work and the storage, processing and analysis of big data can be problematic. MapReduce is a recent programming model that can handle big data. MapReduce achieves this by distributing the storage and processing of data amongst a large number of computers (nodes). However, this means the time required to process a MapReduce job is dependent on whichever node is last to complete a task. Heterogeneous environments exacerbate this problem. In this paper we propose a method to improve MapReduce execution in heterogeneous environments. This is done by dynamically partitioning data before the Map phase and by using virtual machine mapping in the Reduce phase in order to maximize resource utilization. Simulation and experimental results show an improvement in MapReduce performance, including data locality and total completion time with different optimization approaches.},

Therefore, the distribution of tasks across CPU and FPGA must be well-balanced so performance and energy are optimized in a highly variant workload scenario. In this paper, we take a step further and, in contrast to existing approaches, exploit DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) on the CPU, together with an intelligent CPU-FPGA resource provisioning mechanism, to further improve energy. For that, we propose EASER, an end user-transparent framework that employs multiple strategies and dynamically selects the most appropriate one to optimize resource provisioning and DVFS according to the warehouse needs, workload properties, and target architecture. Our synergistic DVFS optimization brings up to 22% additional energy gains over our dynamic provisioning alone. Compared to fixed single strategies with DVFS, EASER brings, on average, 71% of energy gains.},

  abstract  = {Given the wide variety of performance demands for various workloads, the trend in embedded systems is shifting from homogeneous to heterogeneous processors, which have been shown to yield performance and energy saving benefits. A typical heterogeneous processor has cores with different performance and power characteristics, that is, high performance and power hungry ("big") cores, and low power and performance ("small") cores. In order to satisfy the memory bandwidth and computation demands of various threads, it is important (albeit challenging) to map threads to cores. Such assignment should take into account that threads could potentially be harmful to each other in the usage of shared resources (e.g., cache, memory).We propose a scheme for dynamic energy-efficient assignment of threads to big/small cores, DIO--E (Distributed Intensity Online-Energy), which is an enhancement of the previously proposed DIO. In contrast to DIO, we take into account both CPU and memory demands of threads to characterize the performance of threads when co-running on the same core at run-time. Our results show that DIO--E improves the energy-delay-squared product (ED2) by 9\% (average) over DIO, running on a performance-asymmetric multicore system. Both DIO and DIO--E show about 50\% improvement in ED2 over a state-of-the-art solution.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we argue that the modern HPC cluster environments contain several bottlenecks both within cluster multicore nodes and between them in the cluster interconnects. These bottlenecks represent resources that can be of high demand to several jobs, concurrently executing on the cluster. As such, the jobs can compete for accessing these resources and experience performance degradation due to contention. We point out, that, although the contention for shared resources like memory hierarchy of the cluster nodes, accessing the cluster interconnects or sharing the floating point unit can incur severe performance degradation to the cluster workload, the state-of-the-art cluster schedulers do not contain adequate means of addressing it. To fill this gap, we propose a new set of metrics that models shared resource contention and represents a fine-grained information about each job's resource utilization and communication patterns. The necessary information can be obtained with the performance counters within cluster nodes and cluster interconnect monitoring between them.},

Simulators are now commonly used in this area and are becoming more complex. Most of them provide frameworks for simulating application scheduling in various Grid infrastructures, others are specifically developed for modeling networks, but only a few of them simulate energy-efficient algorithms. This article describes which tools need to be implemented in a simulator in order to support energy-aware experimentation. The emphasis is on DVFS simulation, from its implementation in the simulator CloudSim to the whole methodology adopted to validate its functioning. In addition, a scientific application is used as a use case in both experiments and simulations, where the close relationship between DVFS efficiency and hardware architecture is highlighted. A second use case using Cloud applications represented by DAGs, which is also a new functionality of CloudSim, demonstrates that the DVFS efficiency also depends on the intrinsic middleware behavior.},

  abstract  = {Recently, containers have been used extensively in the cloud computing field, and several frameworks have been proposed to schedule containers using a scheduling strategy. The main idea of the different scheduling strategies consist to select the most suitable node, from a set of nodes that forms the cloud platform, to execute each new submitted container. The Spread scheduling strategy, used as the default strategy in the Docker Swarmkit container scheduling framework, consists to select, for each new container, the node with the least number of running containers. In this paper, we propose to improve the Spread strategy by presenting a new container scheduling strategy based on the power consumption of heterogeneous cloud nodes. The novelty of our approach consists to make the best compromise that allows to reduce the global power consumption of an heterogeneous cloud infrastructure. The principle of our strategy is based on learning and scheduling steps which are applied each time a new container is submitted by a user. Our proposed strategy is implemented in Go language inside Docker Swarmkit. Experiments demonstrate the potential of our strategy under different scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Containers are increasingly gaining popularity and are going to be a major deployment model in cloud computing. However, consolidation technique is also used extensively in the cloud context to optimize resources utilization and reduce the power consumption. In this paper, we present a new containers scheduling consolidation approach for cloud computing environment based on a machine learning technique. Our approach is proposed to address the problem of a company that aims to adapt dynamically the number of active nodes to reduce the power consumption when several containers are submitted online each day by their users. In our context, the frequency of containers submission varies within one hour. However, for each hour, the submission frequency is essentially the same each day. The principle of our approach consists into applying a machine learning technique to detect, from a previous containers submission historical, three submission periods (high, medium and low). Each submission period represents a time slot of one day. For instance, the high submission period represents the slot time where the number of submitted containers is the highest compared to other periods. Then, according to the submission periods slot time, our approach dynamically adapts the number of active nodes that must be used to execute each new submitted container. Our proposed consolidation approach is implemented inside Docker Swarmkit which is a well-known container scheduler framework developed by Docker. Experiments demonstrate the potential of our approach under different scenarios.},

The algorithm employed for scheduling these tasks across the system has a substantial impact on the achieved performance. Despite the numerous DAG scheduling algorithms proposed by researchers, there is a lack of benchmarks that evaluate the performance of such algorithms on a set of real application instances in realistic conditions. Thus developers of runtime systems often resort to the use of simple but inefficient algorithms. In this work we aim to fill this gap by proposing a benchmark for evaluating DAG scheduling algorithms based on a set of 150 real-world workflow instances with up to 1695 tasks and 10 realistic cluster configurations with multi-core machines. We apply this benchmark for evaluation of 16 scheduling algorithms including the well-known static algorithms and the commonly used in practice dynamic algorithms. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark allows to clearly separate and compare the algorithms performance from different angles and to make important observations.},

  abstract = {Cloud computing has become a buzzword in the area of high performance distributed computing as it provides on-demand access to shared pool of resources over Internet in a self-service, dynamically scalable and metered manner. Cloud computing is still in its infancy, so to reap its full benefits, much research is required across a broad array of topics. One of the important research issues which need to be focused for its efficient performance is scheduling. The goal of scheduling is to map tasks to appropriate resources that optimize one or more objectives. Scheduling in cloud computing belongs to a category of problems known as NP-hard problem due to large solution space and thus it takes a long time to find an optimal solution. There are no algorithms which may produce optimal solution within polynomial time to solve these problems. In cloud environment, it is preferable to find suboptimal solution, but in short period of time. Metaheuristic based techniques have been proved to achieve near optimal solutions within reasonable time for such problems. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey and comparative analysis of various scheduling algorithms for cloud and grid environments based on three popular metaheuristic techniques: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and two novel techniques: League Championship Algorithm (LCA) and BAT algorithm.},

The goal is to minimize the completion time of the workflow by reducing the impact of queue wait times. In this paper, we examine the performance impact of the clustering techniques using the Pegasus workflow management system. Experiments performed using an astronomy workflow on the NCSA TeraGrid cluster show that clustering can achieve a significant reduction in the workflow completion time (up to 97\%).},

  abstract  = {Energy efficiency of servers has become a significant research topic over the last years, as server energy consumption varies depending on multiple factors, such as server utilization and workload type. Server energy analysis and estimation must take all relevant factors into account to ensure reliable estimates and conclusions. Thorough system analysis requires benchmarks capable of testing different system resources at different load levels using multiple workload types. Server energy estimation approaches, on the other hand, require knowledge about the interactions of these factors for the creation of accurate power models. Common approaches to energy-aware workload classification categorize workloads depending on the resource types used by the different workloads. However, they rarely take into account differences in workloads targeting the same resources. Industrial energy-efficiency benchmarks typically do not evaluate the system's energy consumption at different resource load levels, and they only provide data for system analysis at maximum system load.In this paper, we benchmark multiple server configurations using the CPU worklets included in SPEC's Server Efficiency Rating Tool (SERT). We evaluate the impact of load levels and different CPU workloads on power consumption and energy efficiency. We analyze how functions approximating the measured power consumption differ over multiple server configurations and architectures. We show that workloads targeting the same resource can differ significantly in their power draw and energy efficiency. The power consumption of a given workload type varies depending on utilization, hardware and software configuration. The power consumption of CPU-intensive workloads does not scale uniformly with increased load, nor do hardware or software configuration changes affect it in a uniform manner.},

  abstract  = {In modern HPC systems with deep hierarchical architectures, large-scale applications often struggle to efficiently utilize the abundant cores due to the saturation of resources such as memory. Co-allocating multiple applications to share compute nodes can mitigate these issues and increase system throughput. However, co-allocation may harm the performance of individual applications due to resource contention. Past research suggests that topology-aware mappings can improve the performance of parallel applications that do not share resources. In this work, we implement application-oblivious, topology-aware process-to-core mappings via different core enumerations that support the co-allocation of parallel applications. We show that these mappings have a significant impact on the available memory bandwidth. We explore how these process-to-core mappings can affect the individual application duration as well as the makespan of job schedules when they are combined with co-allocation. Our main objective is to assess whether co-allocation with a topology-aware mapping can be a viable alternative to the exclusive node allocation policies that are currently common in HPC clusters.},

  abstract = {Several real-world scientific and industrial workflow applications adopt elastic and cost-efficient cloud services to fulfill their requirement. There are two stakeholders in the system, namely the user and the provider each of which tries to maximize its profit and at the same time minimize their possible overall costs. Since task scheduling algorithms for workflow executions determine which task should be possibly executed on what resources, they have a drastic impact on both the user's quality of experiences and on the underlying resource utilization. Indeed, an efficient task scheduling algorithm can meet service-level agreement (SLA) for both sides. For the sake of the importance of the issue, this survey presents a subjective taxonomy on the task scheduling schemes in the literature for workflow executions in cloud computing environments to be a guideline for future improvement. It classifies the literature based on the proposed algorithms in the literature, objectives, stakeholders' requirements, and evaluation metrics. This survey highlights research trends, challenges, research gaps, potential solutions, and future direction. It can also pave the way for further processing, improvement and strengthening of existing approaches or devising novel ones for interested researchers in the field of task scheduling problems.},

Inherently, a resource allocation strategy that takes into account resource utilization would lead to a better energy efficiency; this, in clouds, extends further with virtualization technologies in that tasks can be easily consolidated. Task consolidation is an effective method to increase resource utilization and in turn reduces energy consumption. Recent studies identified that server energy consumption scales linearly with (processor) resource utilization. This encouraging fact further highlights the significant contribution of task consolidation to the reduction in energy consumption. However, task consolidation can also lead to the freeing up of resources that can sit idling yet still drawing power. There have been some notable efforts to reduce idle power draw, typically by putting computer resources into some form of sleep/power-saving mode. In this paper, we present two energy-conscious task consolidation heuristics, which aim to maximize resource utilization and explicitly take into account both active and idle energy consumption. Our heuristics assign each task to the resource on which the energy consumption for executing the task is explicitly or implicitly minimized without the performance degradation of that task. Based on our experimental results, our heuristics demonstrate their promising energy-saving capability.},

  abstract = {Recently, container-based solutions have become de facto compute units of modern cloud-native applications. However, the exponential growth in data traffic and the power consumption of these technologies to handle high data traffic alarm the strong need for energy evaluation approaches in containerized clouds. Furthermore, the proliferation of highly distributed edge clouds raises additional concerns regarding the power consumption of future cloud architectures. This article presents a detailed overview of methods and techniques for monitoring power consumption within popular cloud platforms. The study offers an in-depth evaluation of these approaches, demonstrating variations in measured power consumption based on the chosen technique. A well-known container orchestration platform named Kubernetes (K8s) has been applied in our extensive measurements. This work argues that energy-efficient container clouds will play a vital role in building a more sustainable and eco-friendly digital infrastructure by optimizing power consumption and reducing carbon footprint, paving the way for a greener future. The paper also discusses open challenges and future research directions on energy sustainability, leading to the conclusion, offering lessons learned and prospects on potential solutions to foster sustainable practices within the container ecosystem.}
